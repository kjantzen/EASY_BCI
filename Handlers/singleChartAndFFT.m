%generic data handler for the BNS BCI.
%the main function just determines whether the call to the handler is for 
%initializing or analysing
%the appropriate sub function is then called
%this allows for the creation of any number of single file handlers that
%can be selected as a single file from a user menu or other interface
function outStruct = singleChartAndFFT(inStruct, varargin)

%the initializer is called with only one input variable
    if nargin == 1
        outStruct = initialize(inStruct);
    else
        outStruct = analyze(inStruct, varargin{1}, varargin{2});
    end

end

%this function gets called when data is passed to the handler
function p = analyze(obj,p, dStruct)

    data = dStruct.EEG;
    data = data - mean(data);
    p.chartPlot1.UpdateChart(data, dStruct.Event);

    %initializes the BCI analysis and plotting stream prior to the onset of
